I grew up in Beijing and spent 6 wonderful years at [SSDFZ](http://www.cnuschool.org/). After that, I came to Berkeley and received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in [EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) and [Mathematics](https://math.berkeley.edu/) from [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) where I worked in [BAIR](http://bair.berkeley.edu/) and wrote senior honor thesis with [Prof. Stuart Russell](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/) and [David Moore](https://davmre.github.io/) on parallelizing MCMC inference in models with spatially determined conditional independence relationship.

More generally, my research interests include model-based machine learning, especially in applications to real world problems. I am interested in analyzing the spatial and temporal patterns that arise in dynamical systems using statistical approaches such as deep generative models, automated Bayesian inference, probabilistic programming, etc. For application, I am especially interested in applying statistical machine learning techniques to Biology (i.e. translate biological process to statistical models, analyze patterns through inference, etc). If you're thinking about any of these things, or would like to be, please get in touch!
