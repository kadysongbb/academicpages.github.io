I am a second-year Ph.D student in the Department of Industrial Engineering at University of Washington. 

Previously, I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in EECS and Mathematics from UC Berkeley where I worked in BAIR with Prof. Stuart Russell and Dr. David Moore on parallelizing MCMC inference in models with spatially determined conditional independence relationship. After that, I received my Master's Degree in Applied Mathematics from University of Washington. 

My current research interests are optimization and reinforcement learning.
