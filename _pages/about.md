I am an incoming Ph.D student in the Department of Industrial Engineering at University of Washington. 

Previously, I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in EECS and Mathematics from UC Berkeley where I worked in BAIR and wrote senior honor thesis with Prof. Stuart Russell on parallelizing MCMC inference in models with spatially determined conditional independence relationship. After that, I received my Master's Degree in Applied Mathematics from University of Washington. 

My research interests are data science and machine learning for Industrial Engineering. I would like to develop new statistical models and computational tools for understanding the performance of production systems with uncertain information or large scale data. I have a broad interest in different kinds of systems, i.e. complex networked systems.
