I received my Bachelor’s Degree in [EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) and [Mathematics](https://math.berkeley.edu/) from [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) where I worked in [BAIR](http://bair.berkeley.edu/) and wrote senior honor thesis with [Prof. Stuart Russell](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/) and [David Moore](https://davmre.github.io/) on parallelizing MCMC inference in models with spatially determined conditional independence relationship. 

More generally, my research interests include model-based machine learning, especially in applications to Biological and Earth sciences. I am interested in analyzing the spatial and temporal patterns that arise in dynamical systems, such as some biological systems and signal-based seismic systems. I would love to explore techniques like deep generative models, automated Bayesian inference, probabilistic programming and to use/develop these techniques to help understanding dynamical systems. If you're thinking about any of these things, or would like to be, please get in touch!
