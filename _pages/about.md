I grew up in Beijing and spent 6 wonderful years at [SSDFZ](http://www.cnuschool.org/). After that, I came to Berkeley and received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in [EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) and [Mathematics](https://math.berkeley.edu/) from [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) where I worked in [BAIR](http://bair.berkeley.edu/) and wrote senior honor thesis with [Prof. Stuart Russell](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/) and [David Moore](https://davmre.github.io/) on parallelizing MCMC inference in models with spatially determined conditional independence relationship.

More generally, my main mathematical interests are dynamical systems, probability theory, stochastic processes and scientific computing. My main research goal is to develop and apply mathematical/statistical tools to problems arising in biology or other real-world domain. I am especially interested in the spatio-temporal analysis of deterministically or stochastically modeled biology systems. If you're thinking about any of these things, or would like to be, please get in touch!
