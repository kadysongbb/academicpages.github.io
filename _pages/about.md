I received my Bachelor’s Degree in [EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) and [Mathematics](https://math.berkeley.edu/) from [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) where I worked in [BAIR](http://bair.berkeley.edu/) and wrote senior honor thesis with [Prof. Stuart Russell](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/) and [David Moore](https://davmre.github.io/) on parallelizing MCMC inference in models with spatially determined conditional independence relationship. Before coming to Berkeley, I spent 6 wonderful years at [首师附](http://www.cnuschool.org/)

More generally, my research interests include model-based machine learning, especially in applications to Biological and Earth sciences.  I am interested in building dynamical systems models and analyzing the spatial and temporal patterns that arise in dynamical systems.  And I would love to explore topics like deep generative models, automated Bayesian inference, probabilistic programming and to use/develop these techniques to help understanding dynamical systems such as biological systems and seismic systems. If you're thinking about any of these things, or would like to be, please get in touch!
