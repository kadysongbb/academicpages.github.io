I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in [EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) and [Mathematics](https://math.berkeley.edu/) from [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) where I wrote senior honor thesis with [Prof. Stuart Russell](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/) and [David Moore](https://davmre.github.io/) on parallelizing MCMC inference in models with spatially determined conditional independence relationship. 

More generally, my research interests include model-based machine learning, especially in applications to Biological and Earth sciences. I am interested in analyzing the spatial and temporal patterns that arise in dynamical systems, for example some biological systems and signal-based seismic systems. I would love to explore topics like deep generative models, automated Bayesian inference, probabilistic programming and to develop these techniques to help understanding dynamical systems. If you're thinking about any of these things, or would like to be, please get in touch!
