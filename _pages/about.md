I grew up in Beijing and spent 6 wonderful years at [SSDFZ](http://www.cnuschool.org/). After that, I came to Berkeley and received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in [EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) and [Mathematics](https://math.berkeley.edu/) from [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) where I worked in [BAIR](http://bair.berkeley.edu/) and wrote senior honor thesis with [Prof. Stuart Russell](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/) and [David Moore](https://davmre.github.io/) on parallelizing MCMC inference in models with spatially determined conditional independence relationship.

My research interests are data science and machine learning for Industrial Engineering. I would like to develop new statistical models and computational tools for understanding the performance of production systems with uncertain information or large scale data. I have a broad interest in different kinds of systems, i.e. complex networked systems.
